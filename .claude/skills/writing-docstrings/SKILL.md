# Google Style Docstrings And Comments

Use the Google Python Style Guide as the governing policy for docstrings and
use the examples below as the preferred local formatting examples.

Diátaxis is primarily for docs pages. For docstrings, apply only the lightweight
version below: prefer precise reference-style API facts, with brief explanation
or examples only when they help the caller use the API correctly.

## Required docstring rules

- Always use triple double quotes (`"""`) for docstrings.
- Start each docstring with a one-line summary ending in `.`, `?`, or `!`.
  Keep the summary on one physical line no longer than 88 characters.
- Write docstrings as deliberate API documentation a senior engineer would keep
  in the codebase, not as agent notes about what was found, tried, fixed, or
  verified.
- If more detail follows the summary, add one blank line before the longer
  description.
- Function and method docstrings are required for public APIs, nontrivial
  functions, and functions with non-obvious logic. Small private helpers may use
  a one-line docstring when their signature and name are clear.
- Test module docstrings are not optional. Add them so that they provide useful
  context, such as what is being tested, unusual setup, dependencies, or how to run/update fixtures.
  Do not add boilerplate docstrings such as `"""Tests for foo."""`.
- Document call semantics and caller-visible side effects, not implementation
  details. Put implementation notes in comments near the code.
- Explain purpose, behavior, edge cases, and constraints. Do not restate the
  function, class, or parameter names in prose.
- Keep docstrings synchronized with code changes. Update docstrings whenever a
  code change makes existing documentation stale.
- If a docstring exceeds the 88-character line limit, rewrite it concisely. Do
  not truncate text or wrap awkwardly mid-phrase.
- Use either descriptive style (`"""Fetches rows."""`) or imperative style
  (`"""Fetch rows."""`) consistently within a file.

## Inline comments

- Inline comments must explain why the code exists, not what the code does.
- Add comments only when they explain non-obvious business logic,
  domain-specific constraints, safety concerns, algorithms, performance
  tradeoffs, library workarounds, or temporary hacks with ticket references.
  Prefer clearer code over comments for ordinary control flow.
- Do not leave AI-slop comments: no progress notes, literal findings,
  self-congratulation, implementation transcripts, or statements that something
  "works". Comments should read like concise guidance from a human maintainer.
- Do not place comments at the end of code lines. If a comment describes a
  specific line or block, put the comment on the preceding line aligned with
  the code it describes.
- Do not add comments for self-explanatory code, trivial operations, changelog
  notes, or closing-brace/block markers.
- Do not use visual separator comments, such as `# ------- text -------` or
  `# ------------`.
- Do not write comments that merely restate code, such as `# increment x` above
  `x += 1`.
- Write comments in clear, professional prose with normal grammar and
  punctuation. Avoid dramatic language, all-caps emphasis, and boilerplate.

## Diátaxis influence on docstrings

- Default to reference-style precision: what the object is, what the caller can
  rely on, parameters, return values, raised interface exceptions, side effects,
  constraints, and edge cases.
- Add brief explanation only when context is necessary to use the API correctly,
  such as a non-obvious invariant, algorithm choice, domain-specific assumption,
  or safety constraint.
- Add short examples only when they materially clarify common usage. Keep them
  canonical, not exhaustive.
- Do not turn docstrings into tutorials or how-to guides. If a learner needs a
  walkthrough, write or link to a docs page instead.

## Sections

- Use section headers ending with a colon, such as `Args:`, `Returns:`,
  `Yields:`, `Raises:`, `Attributes:`, `Examples:`, and `Note:`.
- Use `Yields:` instead of `Returns:` for generators.
- Omit `Returns:` when the function returns only `None`, or when a one-line
  summary that starts with `Return`, `Returns`, `Yield`, or `Yields` fully
  describes the return value.
- In `Args:`, list every parameter by name. Do not repeat obvious types already
  provided by the function signature.
- List variable arguments as `*args` and `**kwargs`.
- Do not include `self` or `cls` in `Args:`.
- In `Raises:`, list only exceptions that are relevant to the public interface.
  Do not document exceptions that occur only when callers violate the documented
  API contract.
- Use a hanging indent of either two or four spaces inside sections. Be
  consistent within a file. This project prefers the four-space style shown
  below.

## Classes, exceptions, and properties

- Classes should have a docstring describing what an instance represents.
- Exception class docstrings should describe what the exception represents, not
  start with boilerplate such as `Raised when...`.
- Pydantic models and settings classes should use class docstrings with an
  `Attributes:` section for public fields. For environment-backed settings,
  include the environment variable name in the field description, such as
  `Env: NEO4J_URI`.
- Public attributes, excluding properties, should be documented in an
  `Attributes:` section or inline near the attribute declaration. Do not mix the
  two styles within the same class/module.
- Document `__init__` parameters either in the class docstring or in the
  `__init__` docstring. Do not duplicate both forms.
- Document properties in the getter. If the setter has notable behavior, mention
  it in the getter docstring.
- An overridden method may omit a docstring when decorated with `@override` and
  the base method contract is unchanged. Add a docstring when the override
  changes or refines caller-visible behavior.

## Types and annotations

- PEP 484 type annotations are required for typed public APIs.
- When parameters, attributes, and return values are annotated, do not repeat
  obvious types in the docstring.
- Include type information in docstrings only when annotations are absent or
  insufficient to explain accepted values, units, shapes, or other semantics.

## Project examples

Use these local patterns when documenting common agrag component types.

### Pydantic data model

```python
class Entity(DataPoint):
    """A resolved entity from the knowledge graph.

    Identity is ``(canonical_name, label)``. An entity may accumulate aliases
    and provenance records across resolution runs.

    Attributes:
        name: Surface-form name as extracted from source text.
        label: Entity type from the schema, such as ``Person`` or
            ``Organization``.
        canonical_name: Resolved canonical identifier, or ``None`` before the
            resolve stage.
        aliases: Known alternate names.
        provenance: Extraction provenance records with surface forms, chunk ids,
            and character offsets.

    Note:
        Entities below the configured confidence threshold are filtered during
        normalization and do not reach aggregation or resolution.
    """
```

### Settings class

```python
class Neo4jSettings(BaseSettings):
    """Neo4j connection configuration.

    All fields are overridable via environment variables with the ``NEO4J_``
    prefix.

    Attributes:
        uri: Bolt connection URI. Env: ``NEO4J_URI``.
        user: Database username. Env: ``NEO4J_USER``.
        password: Database password. Env: ``NEO4J_PASSWORD``.
        database: Target database name. Env: ``NEO4J_DATABASE``.
    """
```

### Pipeline node or complex algorithm

```python
async def normalize_node(state: ExtractionState) -> ExtractionState:
    """Deduplicate and normalize extracted entities and relations per chunk.

    Collapses duplicate entity and relation keys within a chunk, merges
    provenance, and filters low-confidence or too-short entities.

    Args:
        state: Pipeline state carrying per-chunk extraction results.

    Returns:
        Updated pipeline state with ``normalized_chunks`` populated.

    Note:
        Normalization is deterministic, makes no LLM calls, and is safe to
        re-run on already-normalized state.
    """
```
